# Linear Search Iterative Approach:     
# Start from the leftmost element of the aray and iterate through each element .
# If the current element matches with the given element, return the Key Found.  
# If no element matchs with the given element, return Key not Found.  

# The Time complexity of the above algorithm is O(n).  
# Space Complexity of the above algorithm is  O(1).
