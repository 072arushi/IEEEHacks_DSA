# linear Search Iterative Approach

def linear_search(key,arr):    # key is the element to be found
  for i in range(len(arr)):    #iterating through each index
    if arr[i] == key:          #Comapring each element with key element
      return "Key Found"
  return "Key Not Found"

# Driver's Code:
if __name__ == "__main__":
  arr = [10,13,16,12,5,2,20]
  print(linear_search(2,arr))
