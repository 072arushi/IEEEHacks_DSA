# IEEEHacks_DSA

Algorithms and data structures are fundamental to efficient code and good software design. Creating and designing excellent algorithms is required for being an exemplary programmer. This repository's goal is to demonstrate how to correctly implement common data structures and algorithms in the simplest and most elegant ways.

# Contributing
This repository is contribution friendly :smiley:. If you'd like to add or improve an algorithm, your contribution is welcome!
 * Contributions are always welcome. Language doesn't matter. Just make sure you're implementing an algorithm.
 * PRs are welcome. To begin developing, follow the structure:

   > Algorithm-Type/algorithm-name/language-name/file-name.extension
   
   e.g
   > Sorting/bubble-sort/python/bubble-sort.py

 * If there is an implementation of the same algorithm in your language, do not give a PR for that.
 * Please include a description for the algorithm that you are implementing. It doesn't matter if it's copied from somewhere as long as it helps people that are learning new algorithm.
 * Graphical examples would be very helpful too.
 * You can include tests as well.
 * Don't remove previous implementations of algorithms. You can help in improving the current implementation by adding explanations and examples.
 * Beautify and clean up your code for easier reading
 
 ### Note:
 * **Do not make a new issue unless required.**
 * If your PR is closed without any comment, it means that your PR does not meet the above criteria. Make sure your PR is **not Duplicate** and it should be **well-documented**.
 * Add a readme to your file explaining your code using the algorithm. Also, you need to write the full code including the driver code and add comments in your code too.
