In the following graph, we start traversal from **vertex 2.**
<br>

<br> 

When we come to vertex 0, we look for all adjacent vertices of it. 
<br>

- 2 is also an adjacent vertex of 0. <br>


- If we donâ€™t mark visited vertices, then 2 will be processed again and it will become a non-terminating process.

There can be multiple BFS traversals for a graph. Different BFS traversals for the above graph :
  <br>
 
 - 2, 3, 0, 1<br>
  
  
- 2, 0, 3, 1
  <br>
