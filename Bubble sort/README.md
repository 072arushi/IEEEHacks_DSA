# Bubble Sort Algorithm 
# The bubble sort algorithm is one of the sorting algorithm of the sorting algorithms.  
# In bubble sort algorithm we sort the given unsorted array by moving the highest element to the end.Hence this ths technique is called bubble sort.  
# To move the highest element to the end we use the swapping technique.  
# Since each time an highest value element is pushed to the end the last elements becomes sorted. Hence in each iteration we decrease the value of length.    

#  Time Complexity Analysis of this algorithm is :
#  Best-case   : O(n) 
#  Average-case: O(n^2)
#  Worst-case  : O(n^2)  

# Let us consider a simple example of an unsorted array where arr = [1,4,2,5,3]
# The operations performed to sort this algorithm are:
# 1  2	4	5	3  
# 1	 2	4	3	5  
# 1	 2	3	4	5  
# The array is sorted
