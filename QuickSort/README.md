# Quick Sort Algoritm in Python  

# QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm like Merge Sort.    
# In this algorithm we picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.  
# In the partition algorithm we consider an element x of an array as the pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all elements smaller than x before x, and put all elements greater than x after x in linear time.
# We apply this partition algorithm on the given array by dividing it into two parts recursively until it is sorted.

#  Time Complexity Analysis of this algorithm is :
#  Best-case   : O(nlogn) 
#  Average-case: O(nlogn)
#  Worst-case  : O(n^2)
