Sum of Nodes of a generic Tree
Finding the sum of all the nodes of a tree and printing it.

Algorithm
->Take tree input
1) Declare a variable sum for storing the the value of the sum of tree nodes
2) Set sum as the root's data
3) use a for loop to iterate to all the nodes of the tree while updating the value of sum using recursion.
4) return th value of sum

Input format:
The first line of input contains data of the nodes of the tree in level order form. 
The order is: data for root node, number of children to root node, data of each of child nodes and so on and so forth for each node.
The data of the nodes of the tree is separated by space.

Output Format :
The first and only line of output prints the sum of all nodes of the given generic tree.
